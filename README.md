## 📊 **DeFi-Specific Usage**

### 🎯 **Smart Contract Monitoring**

Monitor your DeFi protocol's compliance:

```javascript
// Monitor a Uniswap pool for suspicious activity
const poolMonitor = new finAIguard.DeFiMonitor({
  protocol: 'uniswap_v3',
  poolAddress: '0x88e6A0c2dDD26FEEb64F039a2c41296FcB3f5640',
  riskThreshold: 0.7,
  alertChannels: ['discord', 'telegram']
});

await poolMonitor.start();
```

### 💰 **DAO Treasury Compliance**

```javascript
// Set up DAO treasury monitoring
const daoCompliance = new finAIguard.DAOCompliance({
  treasuryAddress: '0xYourDAOTreasury',
  governanceToken: '0xYourToken',
  complianceRules: {
    maxSingleTransaction: '100000', // in USD
    requiresProposal: true,
    votingThreshold: 0.6
  }
});
```

### 🌊 **Cross-Chain Risk Analysis**

```bash
# Analyze cross-chain transaction patterns
curl -X POST https://api.finaiguard.io/v1/cross-chain/analyze \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fromChain": "ethereum",
